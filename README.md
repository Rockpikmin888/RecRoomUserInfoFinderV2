# RecRoomUserInfoFinderV2
The original one was horribly organized; therefore, I thought I would update it.
What this program does is it gets the user input from the console then applies it to this url: https://accounts.rec.net/account?username=
It will add the users input to the end of the string after that it will then use the WebClient class to download the string content from that url.
If no user is found (aka 404) it will tell the user that nothing was found.
Once it gets the UserData it will Deserialize the data, which will make it more organized.
